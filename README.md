# diapers

This app was designed to help parents determine what diaper sizes they will need in the future as their baby grows. Predictions are based on the growth charts for male and female children provided by the World Health Organization. Diaper weight ranges were determined by both the size charts that the individual brands provide as well as the packaging.
